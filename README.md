## BookARoo

## Description
The Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save their favorite books, and view a list of saved books. The application is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The backend uses Apollo Server to implement a GraphQL API, replacing the previous RESTful API.
